SerilogViewer
==========

SerilogViewer is a simple WPF-control to show Serilog-logs.
> â„¹ **NOTE**: This project is forked and heavily based on https://github.com/erizet/NlogViewer  

## How to use?

Usage guidelines will be added when a nuget package is published.
For now refer to the included sample project.

<!--

Add a namespace to your Window, like this:

        xmlns:nlog ="clr-namespace:NlogViewer;assembly=NlogViewer"

then add the control.

        <nlog:NlogViewer x:Name="logCtrl" /> 

To setup NlogViewer as a target, add the following to your Nlog.config.

```xml
  <extensions>
    <add assembly="NlogViewer" />
  </extensions>
  <targets>
    <target xsi:type="NlogViewer" name="ctrl" />
  </targets>
  <rules>
    <logger name="*" minlevel="Trace" writeTo="ctrl" />
  </rules>
```


## Nuget

A NuGet-package is available [here][nuget]. It will try to install the control and a sample Nlog.config.
